Our performance in the 2022-2023 school year led us to be invited to the <a class = bedlink href="https://liquipedia.net/overwatch/Overwatch_Collegiate_Championship/2023/Group_Stage">national collegiate playoffs group stage</a>, where we were knocked out by UIUC, UST, and Ball State. This had us end ~20th in schools from North America.

                    Graduated from FHHS in the class of 2022. I ran track my freshman year where I was remarkably slightly above average but quickly quit to pursue playing competitive video games. One of my favorite spots here is our <a class = bedlink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weldon_Spring_Ordnance_Works">nuclear rock pile</a> a few hundred feet away from school grounds.

                    <br>
                    FHHS has a great engineering program that participates in the PLTW curriculum. My proudest achievements here include making a <a class = bedlink href="https://github.com/Paskul/EDD-Bed-Project">spinning bed</a>. All of this was built for under $200, run by a car battery, and even partly supported by clipboards. I can claim my win here.

                    <br>
                    video games: I helped found the FHHS esports club and team that went on to win state and national titles. I was there at the start of MOSEF, and as far as I know, I'm the first and only player to win state in multiple games (overwatch and valorant). Around 2021 was my high school peak in overwatch where I was ranked 13th in North/South America overall. I had a lot of offers to play for colleges on scholarships (some include Northeastern University and Mizzou) but I decided I'd rather spend more of my time on academics for undergrad.
